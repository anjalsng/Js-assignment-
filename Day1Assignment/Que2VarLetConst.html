  <h1>Difference between var , let and const</h1>
  <h2> var</h2>
  <p>var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.</p>
 <p>var variables can be re-declared and updated</p>
 <h2>let</h2>
 <p>let can be updated but not re-declared</p>
 <h2>const</h2>
<p>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. </p>
<p>const cannot be updated or re-declared</p>
 <p>
 1: var and let can change their value and const cannot change its value</p>
<p>2: var can be accessible anywhere in function but let and const can only be   accessible inside the block where they are declared.
